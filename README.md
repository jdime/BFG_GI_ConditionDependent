================
    plot_condition_dependent_networks_and_barplots_gene_level.pl


Description:
================
Obtains complement sets of condition-dependent genetic interactions from:
a) an -infile_table_between with gene-pairs with condition-dependent genetic interactions for conditions-pairs and
b) an -infile_table_within  with gene-pairs with genetic interactions for each condition
 to plot sign changes like:
 
    neutral  (condition 1) to [positive|negative] (condition 2)
    positive (condition 1) to negative (condition 2)
    negative (condition 1) to positive (condition 2)

 To draw condition-dependent networks and histograms, like this one:
 https://github.com/jdime/BFG_GI_ConditionDependent/blob/master/examples/OUTPUTS/example_outfile.BarplotsAndNetworks.diagonal_up.pdf
 
 
General workflow
================
The general workflow of this script is as follows:
  1. Reads tables with intra-condition genetic interactions (shown as the diagonal of the example output)
  2. Reads tables with sign changes using specified False Discovery Rate cutoffs (shown off-diagonal as both networks and barplots in the example output)
  3. Gets specific gene-pairs changing interaction signs for off-diagonal networks, and frequencies for barplots
  4. Draws networks using a template nodes' position file using Cytoscape
  5. Draws barplots and integrated the networks into the 'matrix' layout using R
  6. Reports output
  7. Ends

DEPENDENCIES
================

This code is a wrapper library written in Perl, and needs Cytoscape to draw the networks and R to draw the barplots and create the matrix formatted final plot.

Dependencies:
1) cytoscape.sh (http://www.cytoscape.org/download.php)
  Tested with versions 2.8.1 and 3.6.0.
  Modify file ~/perl_modules/PathsDefinition/PathsToPrograms.pm
  to specify the path to cytoscape.sh file in 'cytoscape_executable' key
  OR in $CytoscapeSh variable in plot_condition_dependent_networks_and_barplots_gene_level.pl
  
  Troubleshooting 'cytoscape.sh'
 Â 
  If your cytoscape.sh executable doesn't seem to be working, chances are that either you don;t have the correct version of Java or you need to need to tell cytoscape.sh how to find it. In a Console/Terminal do the following:
                  
     cd /Applications/Cytoscape_v3.6.0  ## or wherever your cytoscape.sh file is located
     ./cytoscape.sh ### this may tell you "Unable to find any JVMs matching version "1.7"."

If these commands open the cytoscape.sh GUI, then we are all good (despite the JVM message above)
But if your 'cytoscape.sh' can't find the JVM, first make sure you have the correct Java version (see you Cytoscape version requiriments). Then type:
    
    java -version ### to know the Java you have set up is the correct one
    
Add your Java Home location to your ~/.bash_profile

    export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_161.jdk/Contents/Home ### or whichever version of JDK you have installed.
    
Then open a new Console/Terminal for changes to take effect.
                  
 2) convert      (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php)
                  to trim white background of network images

 3) R and R libraries (gplots and png)
